# AI Codenames Clue Giving Agent
Our project aims to create an AI to play the game “Codenames” in the role of the “spymaster”. In this word association game, the spymaster attempts to get their team to guess a set of words giving as few one word hints (clues) as possible. Additionally, there are some words that, if guessed, result in a loss of points (or even the game).

## Build Instructions
Build the source directory using the Kotlin CLI or some other (more sophisticated) build system...
